1) Correcting an error
--------

You have been working at LinkedIn for the last few months on a new project: Sales Recommender (“SR”), which is an affiliate marketing tool. SR works like this - if you sign up for SR as a “Salesperson” and someone in your network introduces you to someone outside of your network who then generates a sale, you can give “X” free month’s subscription to LinkedIn Premium to the person inside your network who linked you to the person outside of your network, or a cash tip.

Your job on this project was to estimate how much this tip, or “X” should be using some price sensitivity data that you have about LinkedIn customers, coupled with a large number of survey results from salespeople on LinkedIn. While a survey isn’t a perfect mechanism, the size of the sample coupled with the response rate leads you to believe in its veracity.

You’ve run the data a number of times, and have come to the conclusion that you should give away 3 months of premium as a tip. However, on the night before the product’s launch, you re-ran the data and noticed something interesting: it appeared the survey wasn’t localized properly and people were putting the results in their home country currency and not in US dollars. After fixing this issue, you re-ran your analysis and came to the conclusion that the proper tip should be 14 days, not 3 months. Because of the gross disparity between your prior tip estimate and current tip estimate, you believe that if the product goes live in its current state, it will be a dud. People will use it once, forget about it, and all the hard work put into it will be for naught.

Your boss, Sankeerti, has already left for the day and you decide to fire off an email letting her know about this issue.

2) Stopping gossip
------

Over the last 3 months you’ve been working hard as an Data Analyst intern at CandyCrack, the free-to-play video game company. It has been a fun job so far and you were glad to make the decision to intern here, rather than BigInsurance.net. In your spare time you’ve been doing some analysis on the effectiveness of cross-game advertising. In particular, some games at CandyCrack show advertisements for other CandyCrack games, rather than selling ads to the highest bidder. You were wondering which one had higher click-through-rates (CTR), since it could be considered a proxy for the likability of the advertisements being shown.

While advertising isn’t in your domain, you are familiar enough with the database to pull the relevant data. Surprisingly, the cross-promotional advertisements had half the click through rates (CTR) of the non-CandyCrack advertisements. You happen to mention you were surprised by this during an intern happy hour on Zoom.

A week later, you receive the following email (note that you are me@candycrack.ai) from your boss, Asif Rush, the Director of Analytics at CandyCrack. This email also includes Kathleen, who is the VP of Marketing, and Kim, Benny, and Zane who are the other data analysts under Asif. How will you respond to this email?

> Asif –  
> I’ve been dealing with a bit of an issue. I wanted to let you know that I don’t appreciate your team spreading misinformation regarding our advertising efforts. Turns out one of your data analysts has been telling people that our cross-promotional efforts are only half as effective as the advertisements that we show for other titles. I’m not sure where this information came from and what, so-called “data” your data-team is using, but the marketing analysts have spent significant amounts of time balancing a number of important factors to optimize, such as how much we get paid for each advertisements. The last thing I need is another data analyst undercutting their work behind their back.  
> If you could fix your team, it would be appreciated.  
> Kathy.  
 
Note about Academic Integrity
------

This assignment should be your independent work, no working with your peers or GPT-3. You should use assistants tools, such as Grammarly and Hemingway Editor, to improve the quality of your writing. 

I turned on the Turntin option on Canvas, a system that compares your submissions to all previous submissions, to deter plagiarism. You have access to the Turntin report for transparency.
