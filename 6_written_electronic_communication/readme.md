__Examples of Professional Emails__:

- Read [3 different emails that layoffs employees](https://www.viamaven.com/blog/employee-layoff-annoucement-sample-example) Announcing massive layoffs is one of the most difficult emails a business person has to write. The goal is to convey the relevant information in an empathic and logical manner.  

- Read ["Email to former board member"](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/17tEc9ETL4tjfTmNbpwJJ5OSx1c4j10ZBgeYXWGzO30Y/mobilebasic#). Ryan Caldbeck posted this __publicly__ with the redactions.
