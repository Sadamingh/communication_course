Prework
======

__Required__:

Before the start of class, please complete the following:

1. Submit the topic of your presentation on Canvas. See section below for guidance.

2. Watch these videos:
    - [The Top 8 Business Presentation Skills](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QT5vlkGM810) - A little too slick but still useful.
    - [Overcome Your Fear of Public Speaking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVIWqp7I6bE) - Yep! We are going after the fear.
    - [How To Give A TED Talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohZk7pPJN8o) - TED talks are effective for spreading ideas, however they do not have rigorous standards for technical and science communication.

3. Bring a rough draft of your presentation (e.g., topic, outline, storyboard for slides).

__Optional__:

- [How To Speak by Patrick Winston](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Unzc731iCUY&ab_channel=MITOpenCourseWare)

Presentation details about topic selection
------

The last assignment will be individual presentations. Your presentation will be a 4 minute "Lightning"-style talk. 

Pick a technical topic that you are passionate about. It could be an algorithm, a technique, a package from your favorite programming framework, or a piece of software. The topic should be data related.

Common faults in topic selection:

- Too broad / Too abstract
- Too technical / Too cutting edge
- Not interesting
- Not enough personal knowledge
