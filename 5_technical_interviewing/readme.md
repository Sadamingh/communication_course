Prework
======

__Required__:

The require prework is increasing your familiarity with the style of your coding interview problems. 

In coding interviews, you need to be able to solve coding challenges: independently, successfully, and quickly. 

Attempt these problems individually without looking at any resources. Additionally, you must solve them only the editor provided. In most coding interviews, you will not get access to your choice of coding environments.

Time box your attempts. Do not spend hours on these problems. It is okay to stop work on a coding interview problem if you are not making progress. 

Level 1: [Majority Element](https://leetcode.com/problems/majority-element/)

Level 2: [Daily Temperatures](https://leetcode.com/problems/daily-temperatures/)

Level 3: [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/)

After you code your solutions, judge your code with the following [Code Review Rubric](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14NKOxYH9HHfndo0TJyCYpFwOTv4Unb0diNmm6EigJjY/edit?usp=sharing)

Deliverables to Canvas:

For each problem, paste in your code attempt and the time you spent on it. The prework will be graded all or nothing based on attempting each problem. Your code or time will not be graded.
